  <h2>Hundred Islands</h2>
  <p>
  Pangasinan on the western side of Luzon is a travel-worthy destination in the Philippines because of its scenic islands, beautiful beaches, stunning waterfalls, verdant hills, and many more. One of its most popular attractions is called the Hundred Islands National Park, a protected area and the Philippines’ first national park. An island-hopping trip around the Hundred Islands National Park will give you access to some of the 124 islands and islets off Alaminos, Pangasinan.

  <h2>Batan Island</h2>
  <p>
  Among the most distinctly captivating destinations in the Philippines is the archipelagic province of Batanes at its northernmost end. While there are innumerable pristine beaches in the country, there is nothing quite like the verdant rolling landscapes of Batanes. For this, many tag the province “The New Zealand of the Philippines”. Of the 10 islands that make up the province, three are inhabited: Sabtang, Itbayat, and Batan.

  <h2>Matinloc Island</h2>
  <p>
  Home to some of Bacuit Bay’s most famous tourist attractions such as Matinloc Shrine, Secret Beach, and Hidden Beach, Matinloc Island is a must on anyone’s first trip to El Nido. The covert beaches are concealed by El Nido’s iconic limestone formations and Matinloc Shrine offers some of the best panoramic views in the area. These are all stops on El Nido’s Tour C package in addition to nearby Star Beach and Helicopter Island.

  <h2>Pamalican</h2>
  <p>
  For the epitome of a luxurious tropical escape, head to the island of Pamalican in Palawan—aboard no less than a private plane, of course. This island northeast of mainland Palawan is home to the exclusive Amanpulo Resort by the Aman Resorts International hotel group. Pamalican Island is one of their many sites alongside other dreamy destinations like Bali, Indonesia and Porto Heli, Greece.

  <h2>Siargao</h2>
  <p>
  Siargao, a tear-dropped island at the northeastern tip of Mindanao, is best known for being the surfing capital of the Philippines. This tropical paradise is often hailed by local and international publications as one of the best islands in the world. It has stunning islands, powdery white sand beaches, natural lagoon pools, and gorgeous mangrove forest reserve to name a few. The island of Siargao shot to fame when international surfers discovered its barrel-shaped waves, considered one of the best in the world, in General Luna.

  <h2>Naked Island</h2>
  <p>
  Naked Island got its name because there are no structures or vegetation on it. It’s just a patch of fine white sand in the middle of the sea. You can spend an hour or so here beach bumming or wading in the clear waters. Daku Island is the biggest of the three (“daku” is their local word for “big”) and also has huts for rent. The long stretch of powdery, white sand and the swaying trees make for an idyllic backdrop for those who want a relaxing trip. Bring some snacks and have a picnic, but always leave no trace behind.
